##Introduction
The **Step Sequencer with Euclidean Rhythm Generator** is a 8 channels step sequencer created to control other synthesizers.
The primary aim of the **Step Sequencer with Euclidean Rhythm Generator** is to generate organized signals called triggers to 
syncronize with other synthesizer modules and generate/erase/modify Euclidean Rhythm sequences with the aid of a easy interface.
Other resources are available:

-8 channels / 16 steps
-play / pause;
-reset the step counter;
-remove the entire sequence;
-add/delete just one step;
-shift sequence;
-tempo speed;
-euclidean generator;
-track mute;
-master clock out;
-clock in.

The <a href="http://aisynthesis.com/">AI Syntehsis</a> is working on prototyping the module.

Please, contact me if you want to make anything commercially.

Thank you.
