##Introduction
The **Step Sequencer with Euclidean Rhythm Generator** is an 8 channels step sequencer created to control other synthesizers.
The primary aim of the **Step Sequencer with Euclidean Rhythm Generator** is to generate organized triggers to 
syncronize it with other synthesizer modules and generate/erase/modify Euclidean Rhythm sequences with the aid of a easy interface.
Other resources are available:

<ul>
<li>8 tracks / 16 steps</li>
<li>play / pause;
<li>reset the step counter;
<li>remove the entire sequence;
<li>add/delete just one step;
<li>shift sequence;
<li>tempo speed;
<li>euclidean generator;
<li>track mute;
<li>master clock out;
<li>clock in.
</ul>

The <a href="http://aisynthesis.com/">AI Syntehsis</a> is working on prototyping the module.

Please, contact me if you want to make anything commercially.

Thank you.
